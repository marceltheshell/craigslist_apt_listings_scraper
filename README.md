# craigslist_apt_listings_scraper
A simple scraper I came up with that scrapes the first 100 listings of apartment rental page in every city in CA.  It includes most the information you might need to know about an apt (address, date, Posting_id, Posting_ title, price, # of bedrooms,  sqft and city) but unfortunately not the lattitude/ longitude which was significantly tougher to get.  If you appreciate this please star the repo.  Cheers!
